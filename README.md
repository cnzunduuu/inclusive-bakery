#  The Inclusive Bakery Website

### A Neurodivergent-Friendly Web Design Project

---

## Project Overview

**The Inclusive Bakery** is a concept website for a fictional bakery designed with a focus on **neurodivergent accessibility**. The goal is to create a calm, inclusive browsing experience that reduces cognitive load and sensory overstimulation through intentional design choices in **typography**, **colour**, and **layout**.

This project forms a foundation for learning **core front-end development** concepts ‚Äî especially **CSS layout (Flexbox & Grid)**, **responsive design**, and **semantic HTML** ‚Äî without the use of frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.

## Key Accessibility Features

The design implements **WCAG**-aligned best practices for **cognitive accessibility**:

- **Low-Contrast Colour Palette:** Soft, warm tones chosen to reduce visual stress and prevent text ‚Äúhalation‚Äù (the glowing effect around text common in high-contrast designs).  
- **Typography:**
  - [**Lexend**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend): used for body text to improve readability and reduce character crowding.
  - [**Onest**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Onest): used for headings to provide clear, structured hierarchy.  
- **Theme Toggle:** Includes a functional **Dark Mode toggle** using **CSS variables** (`:root` and `[data-theme="dark"]`), allowing users to customise their visual environment.  
- **Clear Layout:** Minimalistic design with generous whitespace, no distracting animations, and a strong visual hierarchy for effortless navigation.  
- **Skip Link:** A hidden ‚ÄúSkip to Content‚Äù link improves **keyboard accessibility** for screen reader and tab-navigation users.

## Learning Focus

This project demonstrates practical understanding of:

- **CSS Variables:** Defining and applying site-wide themes with easy maintenance.  
- **Pure Responsiveness:** Adapting layouts across mobile, tablet, and desktop using `@media` queries.  
- **Semantic HTML5:** Proper use of `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for accessibility and SEO.  
- **Layout Systems:** Mastery of **Flexbox** and **Grid** for structure and responsive alignment.  
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** Implementing the dark/light mode toggle and saving user preferences via `localStorage`.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** Semantic structure and accessible markup.  
- **CSS3:** Layouts, variables, theming, and responsiveness.  
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Theme logic and accessibility enhancements.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a **tab index** for smoother keyboard navigation.  
- Add **ARIA labels** for form elements (e.g., contact form).  
- Create an **‚ÄúOrder Online‚Äù page** prototype to demonstrate consistent accessibility patterns.
